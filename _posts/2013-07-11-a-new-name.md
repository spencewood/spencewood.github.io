title: A new name
---

I got married! And with it, a new name.

I've (almost) always been called Tyler Collard. When Beth and I were planning for our big day and our future life together, the subject of names came up. Although I was pretty attached to my name (aren't we all?), changing it to something brand new seemed almost naturual. After a lot of consideration, we decided to combine our mothers' maiden names: Spencer and Southwood.

I am now Tyler Spencewood. Bring on the paperwork!
