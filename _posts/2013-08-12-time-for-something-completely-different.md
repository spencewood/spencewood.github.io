title: Time for something completely different
---

I've enjoyed the past three years working for The Nerdery, but I recently called it quits to try something new. I learned a ton, and got the opportunity to see a truly small company mature into a large one. It's been very interesting and rewarding!

Beth and I are going to travel the world for a while and live in some new places. First we are going to tour the U.S., followed by month of travelling in Europe, and then more travelling throughout China and southeast Asia. We have no end date set.

My plan plan is to keep learning and working abroad, while soaking up new places and culture!
