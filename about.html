        Hi there, my name is Tyler and I am a first generation Spencewood.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a web developer by nature, if one can be called that. I have been creating web sites since the 90s, and it is both my passion and professional career. I practically dream in HTML and JavaScript. <strong>I make the web</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also a traveller, philosopher, linguist, futurist, avid indie music fan, history nut and board gamer. I also really enjoy <strong>good beer</strong>.
    </p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
    I have literally worked on hundreds of web sites written in a dozen different programming languages (and different human languages too). From small personal home pages to enterprise solutions, <strong>I've done it all</strong>. Most of these have been under the guise of a company I work for, but you can find the stuff I do in my spare time on <a href="http://www.github.com/tcollard">Github</a>.
