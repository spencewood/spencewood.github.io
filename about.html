        Hi there, my name is Tyler and I am a first generation Spencewood.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a web developer by nature, if one can be called that. I have been creating web sites since the 90s, and it is both my passion and professional career. I practically dream in HTML and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also a traveller, philosopher, linguist, avid indie music fan, history nut and board gamer. I also really enjoy good beer.
    </p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
    I have literally worked on hundreds of different web sites written in dozens of different programming languages (and different human languages too). From small personal home pages to enterprise solutions, I've done it all. Most of these have been under the guise of a company I work for, but you can find the stuff I do in my spare time on <a href="http://www.github.com/tcollard">Github</a>.
